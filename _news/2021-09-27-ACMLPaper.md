Our new collaborative paper {% cite godaz2021acml %} on an exciting, if a bit theoretical, method for improving a common optimziation method has been accepted to ACML:

{% reference godaz2021acml %}

RLBFGS is a common quasi-Neton method for optimization using Reimannian manifolds, but the method is very computationally expensive. In this paper we present how altering two mappings (vector transport and adjoint) in the algorithm can lead to a significant computational perforamnce gain with very little loss in accuracy.
