# Mark Crowley's Website

This is the development repository for my main research website at [https://markcrowley.ca](https://markcrowley.ca). 

### Relevant Files Map:

If you need to make changes or suggestions you can do the appropriate git thing (fork, update, push, create pull request) so for the following files which map to the website layout via the black magic incantations of `jekyll+al-folio+latex+jekyll-scholar`:

- Pages
- Topics
- Projects
- People (not fully developed yet, but feel free to fill in your page! Especially "where are they now" if you've graduated from the lab)
- News
- Teaching : `/_courses/?`

## Contributing

This development repository is open to be edited and receive pull requests. If you are in my lab, a student in my courses, or a collaborator, feel free to make corrections or changes that are relevant to you and submit a pull request. I will take a look and if it's appropriate merge it into my [main website](https://markcrowley.ca) when I get a chance. *(Note: I may not do this especially quickly, but I will get around to it. If it is an urgent correction or a newly published paper from the lab use the appropriate means to get my attention :) )*
