Inspired by a challenge raised by [Prof. Jean-Pierre Hickey](/people/jeanpierrehickey/) in Mechanical Engineering I have worked to investigate novel ways to use Deep Neural Network to revolutionize the way combustion simulation calculations are computed and stored. 
This research is relevant for the design of combustion engines and energy production. 
Our results are significantly better than existing approaches and could lead to an order of magnitude speed up in some combustion simulation models. I presented this work at the ECML conference in September and have made significant connections based on it. 
The bullk of the work was carried ou by my MASc student [Sushrut Bhalla](/people/sushrutbhalla/)
We successfully published a paper on at the very well regarded European Conference on Machine Learning and I presented it at the conference in Germany. All of the collaborators are currently working on a journal version with additional results to submit early this year.
