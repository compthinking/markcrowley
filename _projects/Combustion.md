Inspired by a challenge raised by [Prof. Jean-Pierre Hickey](/people/jeanpierrehickey/) in Mechanical Engineering I have worked to investigate novel ways to use Deep Neural Network to revolutionize the way combustion simulation calculations are computed and stored. 
This research is relevant for the design of combustion engines and energy production. 
Our results are significantly better than existing approaches and could lead to an order of magnitude speed up in some combustion simulation models. This work was presented at the European Conference on Machine Learning conference in September 2019.
