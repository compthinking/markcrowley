### Course Description

Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (RL) theory and algorithms for learning decision-making policies in situations with uncertainty and limited information. Topics include Markov decision processes, classic exact/approximate RL algorithms such as value/policy iteration, Q-learning, State-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), Temporal Difference (TD) methods, policy gradients, actor-critic, and Deep RL such as Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).



### Required Background

The course will use concepts from ECE 203 and ECE 307 on Bayesian Probability and Statistics, these will be reviewed but familiarity will help significantly. All other concepts needed for the course will be introduced directly. Examples, assignments and projects will depend on programming ability in Python.

### Weekly Schedule

  - Most of the **lectures are available already on Youtube**, *each week* there are associated videos to watch along with readings from the Sutton and Barto textbook.
- A Detailed Course Calendar in the [Course Gingko List](https://gingkoapp.com/course-457c-links-for-students)  will let you know which materials to study each week before Monday's Live Session.
  - **Live Lecture/Review/Discussion Session - ** Every **Monday 4pm - 5:30pm (ET)** there will be a live session with the Prof which will be: 		
    - *Either* a live lecture with new/revised content from what is on YouTube. Lectures will be recorded and available later on YouTube.
    - *Or* a live discussion session to review the content from last week's self-study, working through problems, answering questions, breaking out for discussions. These sessions will be recorded and remain available on LEARN during the term.
  - **Tutorials:** TBD - we'll see how, and if, we do tutorials this year with the new online arrangement.
- ***Bookable Office Hours -***  
  - These are regular, one-on-one (or a small group) meeting slots with the professor, [bookable via doodle](https://doodle.com/mm/markcrowley/bookable-1on1-493t2) a few days ahead of time.
- **TA office hours** - to be determined (some times on Tuesday-Thursdays)

## Course Learning Objectives and Topic Details

### Learning Objectives
This course complements other AI courses in ECE by focussing on the
methods for representation and reasoning about uncertain knowledge for
the purposes of analysis and decision making. At each stage of the
course we will look at relevant applications of the methods being
discussed. 

For example, in 2016 the AI program "AlphaGO" defeated human world class
players of the game Go for the first time. This system requires many
different methods to enable reasoning, probabilistic inference, planning
and decision optimization. In this course we will build up the
fundamental knowledge about these components and how they combine
together to make such systems possible.

1. Identify and Explain the component theoretical concepts of Reinforcement Learning systems.
2. Implement or instantiate using a library any of the core Reinforcement Learning algorithms on a variety of domains. 
3. Evaluate the performance of a particular RL system on a given domain through proper experimental design, statistical analysis and visualization.

  - *Piazza* will be the main place for detailed discussion and questions. Students can post anonymously (from students only), post a collaborative answer and course staff can confirm these, post their own or run Live Q&A events.
  - Go there there and sign up with your UWaterloo email now!
- **Pre-recorded Video Lectures:** These will be made available on the [course youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7vU2kP8oNwvr0GuAqoxYGA), and links from within Learn
- **LEARN Website:** The main course content, announcements, grade tracking and materials will be made available on Learn. All registered students should see this in their LEARN courses.
- **Email the Teaching Assistant and Instructor:** Office Hours will be arranged once term starts as needed.
- **AccessAbility Services :** http://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services 
  - If you need any accommodation, assistance with exams, learning environment, assignments, talk to this office and they can help you set it up as securely and anonymously as possible.

### Discussion Group Protocols

- Posts on Piazza can be public or anonymous to your classmates, but they will *never* be anonymous to the TAs and Instructor. 
- Be kind. Assume the best, not the worst. Think before you hit enter.
- Posts which are considered offensive, abusive, bullying, discriminatory to any group or person, will be made private or deleted and followed up with private discussion.
- If you feel there is inappropriate, hurtful behaviour occurring on the discussion forum, please notify the professor, TAs or department staff as you feel appropriate. 
- If you really can't get in touch with anyone and it is an emergency you can contact Prof. Crowley directory via Microsoft Teams messaging (please don't abuse this though :| )

**Discipline:** A student is expected to know what constitutes academic
integrity---check http: //www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/ to avoid
committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her

offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g.,
plagiarism, cheating) or about rules for group work/collaboration should
seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the
undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences
and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student

Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes
he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student
Appeals) http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm.

**Note for Students with Disabilities:** The Office for Persons with
Disabilities (OPD), located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates
with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for
students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity
of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the
impact of your disability, please register with the OPD at the beginning
of each academic term.
