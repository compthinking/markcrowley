I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I'm a member of the [Waterloo Institute for Artifical Intelligence](http://waterloo.ai/) ([waterloo.ai](http://waterloo.ai/)), the [Waterloo Institute for Complexity and Innovatio](http://wici.ca/)n ([WICI](http://wici.ca/)) and  Secretary of the **[Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association (CAIAC)](https://www.caiac.ca/)** which coordinates the yearly organization of the **Canadian Conference on AI**. I received his Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia working in the [Laboratory for Computational Intelligence](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci) with David Poole. Before coming to Waterloo he completed a postdoc at Oregon State University working with [Tom Dietterichâ€™s machine learning group](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/) on robust decision making under uncertainty in simulated Forest Fire domains.

In my [research](/projects/) I seek out *dependable* and *transparent* ways to *augment* **human decision making** in **complex domains**. That *complexity* is what **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)** makes research so difficult as well as *exciting*. 

The complexity could come from the presence of **spatial structure**, large scale **streaming data**, **uncertainty**, or **unknown causal structure**, or **interaction of multiple decision makers**. 

My focus is on developing new *algorithms*, *methodologies*, *simulations*, and *datasets* within the fields of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **Deep Learning**, **Manifold Learning** and **Ensemble Methods**. I often work in *collaboration* with academic researchers, industry researchers and engineers or policy-makers in diverse fields such as **sustainable forest management**, **physics and chemistry**, **autonomous development** and **medical imaging**. 

I'm always happy to talk to people about my research, or the impact of AI/ML/RL on our world and its role in our society in the future. I do not take on many incoming students, so if you are hoping to join my lab as a graduate student for research please [read this note](/joining-my-lab/).
