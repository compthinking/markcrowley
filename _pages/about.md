Site being updated, see my <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/mcrowley">Research Lab</a> page for current information.


My research seeks dependable and transparent ways to augment human decision making in complex domains in the presence of spatial structure, large scale streaming data, or uncertainty.  My focus is on developing new algorithms within the fields of **[Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement-learning)**, **[Deep Learning](deep-learning)** and **[Ensemble Methods](ensemble-methods)**, and **[Manifold Learning (Dimensionality Reduction)](manifold-learning)**.  
I often work in collaboration with researchers in applied fields such as  **[Computational Sustainability](computational-sustainability)** (including [Sustainable Forest Management](forest-management)), **[Autonomous Driving](autonomous-driving)**, **AI for Physics** (including [Combustion Modelling](Combustion) and [Digital Chemistry](chemgymrl)) and **[Medical Imaging](medical-imaging)**.

<h2 class="lined">Note for Potential Graudate Students</h2>

As of *Sept 28, 2020* I have enough graduate students and I am not accepting new applications. Good luck with your search though.
