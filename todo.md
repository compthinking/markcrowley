# TODO List


## Layouts
- 2021-05-29 : various ideas on remarkable about this, but I relaly should use whatever was working in compthink first. 
    - **New idea:** keyword=permalink of page, all pages have same format in that way.
    - also all pages can have people, publications, related projects and related grants, it's ust a matter of going through all the keywords, figuring out which collection they are ni, if any, then lop through those to show tem
    - eventually each type fo item can have custom per item diplay layouts too.

## Content

- [ ] Fill in project and topic descriptions. Each one can have a unique permalink, it doesn't need to be in a hierarchy, to [RL](reinforcement-learning) is just that, for anything related to it. 
- [ ] Could there be a standard loop over keywords and organized by page type or collection? So on the RL page then you'd get a link of 
  - people
  - projects
  - topics
  - blogs
  - Grants etc
- [ ] Particular pages
  - [ ] Medical-imaging
-  [ ] Project pages
	- [ ] banner images
	- [ ] short description
	- [ ] some longer text
	- [ ] related papers, people, posts
	- [ ] layout: meta info should show up on project page (or any page?)  
	- [ ] Make the showing of people, links, papers optional with tags in the header or any "page"?
	- [ ] Then make the correct set of choices be default for different collections?
	- [ ] Or should the page layout itself be changed for each type? (Keep it simple for now!)
